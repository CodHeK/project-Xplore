// make sure you have go installed and PATH set once that is done just run

GO TO localhost:90/word/{you-word-here}

DEPTH can be set using the maxDepth variable in the main.go file
```

### In the end

Well, if you're wondering what is the use of doing this! I didn't find any except you can know synonyms of synonyms 
(don't know how that is useful, but ok! :stuck_out_tongue:) It was just a coding excercise I came up with to try out new things!
